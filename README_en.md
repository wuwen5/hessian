## Introduction

This project is a refactored and modularized version of the original [Hessian](http://hessian.caucho.com/) repository, with all RPC-related logic removed. It focuses solely on maintaining and enhancing the **Hessian serialization protocol**.

> The new commits are copied from the source code of `hessian-4.0.xx-sources.jar` in [https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/caucho/hessian/](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/caucho/hessian/)

The Hessian serialization protocol remains widely used in practice due to the following advantages:

* ‚ö° **High Performance**: Fast (de)serialization
* üì¶ **Compact Size**: Efficient binary encoding
* üåê **Cross-language Compatibility**: Useful in polyglot systems
* üõ†Ô∏è **Ease of use**: simple to use, no predefined data structure required

### ‚úÖ Object Reference Reuse: Hessian2‚Äôs Unique Strength

Hessian2 **supports shared references and cyclic object graphs** out-of-the-box. It detects duplicated object instances and reuses them during serialization, and can correctly handle circular references without stack overflow or infinite loops.

In contrast:

| Format       | Shared References | Cyclic References | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hessian2** | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Yes             | Native support, no special handling                                    |
| **JSON**     | ‚ùå No              | ‚ùå No              | Value copy only; circular references cause errors                      |
| **Protobuf** | ‚ùå No              | ‚ùå No              | Tree-based, cannot represent object graphs with cycles or shared state |

### üåç When Hessian2 Still Shines

These features make Hessian2 ideal for scenarios such as:

* Java object persistence or caching with shared/circular references
* Deep cloning or snapshotting of runtime state
* Java-to-Java microservice communication with contextual state
* RPC frameworks that demand full fidelity object reconstruction

Even in modern systems, **Hessian2 remains irreplaceable** in certain specialized fields due to its fidelity, compactness, and ease of integration.

### Overview of Hessian2 Protocol

Hessian2 is an enhanced version of the original Hessian protocol, with the following features:

* Binary serialization of Java primitives, collections, and custom classes
* **Object reference support** to prevent redundant serialization
* **Class definition caching** to reduce payload size
* Designed for **high-efficiency data transmission**

üìÑ **Protocol Documentation**: [Hessian2 Protocol Specification (English)](./docs/hessian-serialization.md)

### What‚Äôs Special About This Project

* Strip the RPC-related code from the original Hessian project
* Modularized architecture for better extensibility and maintenance
* Supports **Hessian 2 protocol only**
* Ideal for use as a standalone, high-efficiency serialization library
* Supports Java 11 and above versions

Community contributions are welcome. We are committed to keeping a clean, modular, and efficient implementation of the Hessian serialization protocol in Java.
